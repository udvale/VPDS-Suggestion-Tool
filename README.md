# üí° VPDS Component Suggestion Tool (Frontend)

This is the frontend of the **Visa Product Design System (VPDS) Suggestion Tool**, a web app that allows users to input a query (e.g., "login form with email input") and receive a generated JSX code snippet using components from Visa's design system. 
(Soon will add class diagram)

Communicates with the backend at: https://github.com/udvale/vpds-rec-backend

## Features
- Input UI for freeform component descriptions
- Fetches generated component suggestions from the backend (AI or rule-based)
- üìã Displays both:
  - The list of components used
  - The TSX snippet for copy-paste usage

---

## Assumptions
- The prototype uses 33 Nova‚ÄØReact components (hand‚Äëpicked, each with 1‚Äë3 showcase variants). 
- For every query we run a lightweight semantic scorer (retriever.py). It token‚Äëmatches the query against each component‚Äôs name, description, and tags, adds small bonuses for UI‚Äëpattern cues (‚Äúlogin‚Äù, ‚Äúform‚Äù, etc.), then returns the top‚Äë3 ranked components (k = 3).
- Try GPT‚Äë4o‚Äëmini for smart merge, fall back to regex; if code passes a quick sanity check, save to cache for next time.
