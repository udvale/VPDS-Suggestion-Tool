# üí° VPDS Component Suggestion Tool (Frontend)

This web app helps users generate TSX code snippets using **Visa Product Design System (VPDS)** components based on a natural language query. It sends the query to backend API and shows:
- A list of VPDS components used
- A ready-to-copy TSX code snippet

---

## My Approach
1. Frontend UI
I used Next.js with App Router and TypeScript to build a modern, typed React app. Tailwind CSS made styling fast and clean, and @visa/nova-react is used for actual VPDS components.

2. Component Logic
After the UI was done, I focused on how to suggest components and generate code. 
- Started by collecting ~30 commonly used VPDS components and writing 1‚Äì3 example code snippets for each.
- Used Claude.ai to convert this into a clean JSON file with metadata and tags.
- Tried different approaches for matching a user query to relevant components:
     - First, used simple keyword scoring based on the query and each component‚Äôs description/tags.
     - Then tested Hugging Face's pipeline to classify the query, but it wasn‚Äôt flexible enough.
     - Finally added OpenAI‚Äôs GPT‚Äë4o‚Äëmini to generate code by combining top-ranked components in a natural way.

## Assumptions & Shortcuts
- Used AI (Claude, GPT-4o) to speed up metadata generation for components.json.
- Ranking is based on token overlap + simple UI keyword bonuses ("form", "login", etc.).
- Code generation is handled by OpenAI or rule-based assembly, whichever passes a quick validation.

---

## What I'd Improve with More Time
- Expand support to all VPDS components with better metadata coverage.
- Add smarter validation to ensure generated code compiles and looks right.
- Let users pick between multiple layout options (e.g. stacked vs inline forms).
- Tune AI generation to better follow VPDS usage patterns and prop rules.

cd vpds-rec-frontend
```
2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```
3. **Run the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. **Visit the app**

# üí° VPDS Component Suggestion Tool (Backend)

The backend API for the **VPDS Component Suggestion Tool**, that allows users to input a natural language description and receive TSX code snippet. The backend interprets user intent and suggests appropriate component code by either:
- Looking it up from a cached dataset (csv file) (for known patterns)
- Or generating the result by combining known VPDS components

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python + FastAPI**: Chosen for its speed, simplicity, and modern async support. FastAPI allows clean routing, validation (via Pydantic), and scalability.
- **CSV caching (`pattern-dataset.csv`)**: Allows storing previously seen query/code pairs so repeat queries return instantly.
- **components.json**: A custom dataset mapping 33 component names to metadata and usage examples. Acts as the source of truth for generating JSX.
- **Optional OpenAI integration**: If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is provided, the API can fall back to AI-based generation using gpt-4o-mini (not required for core functionality). Currently has limited tokenzation for query requests. 

---

## What does it do?

- Accepts a plain English description (e.g., `"login form with remember me checkbox"`).
- Checks if it already exists in a cache (CSV file).
- If found, returns the TSX snippet and used VPDS components.
- If not found, attempts to match against the internal pattern rules (or optionally generate via OpenAI).
- Updates the CSV cache automatically with new patterns and results.
